# Earth Orbit and Close Approach Objects Analysis

This project aims to perform initial analysis on two datasets related to near-earth and in-orbit objects. How does the dataset change over the years? How do the different distances from Earth compare? What are the most common objects? How does the object density change? Can we observe future trends and predict how object types and density can change?

## Dataset Information:

Two datasets are used in the project: the first contains near-Earth objects that are passing close to Earth's orbit. The second includes objects that are in Earth's orbit.


## Objectives

The project will involve multiple data analyses, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
